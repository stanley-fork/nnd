// Data structures for the program information: functions, variables, struct fields, etc.
//
// The main goal of this debugger is to work well with the bloated modern binaries with 3 GB of debug symbols.
// So it's important to make these data structures reasonably efficient and compact.
//
// (Note: this long comment at the top of this file is one of the first things written in this project. It's probably quite outdated and wrong and needs to be updated.)
//
// Some rough stats about a typical binary (clickhouse, DWARF4, written in C++, statically linked with lots of libraries, some in rust):
//  * Binary size: 2.4 GB
//  * Size of the .text section (i.e. the actual program): 303 MB
//  * Debug info section sizes:
//     .debug_line       132 MB
//     .debug_abbrev     14 MB
//     .debug_info       853 MB
//     .debug_aranges    6 MB
//     .debug_ranges     128 MB
//     .debug_str        332 MB
//     .debug_pubnames   6 MB
//     .debug_pubtypes   5 MB
//     .debug_loc        449 MB
//     .gdb_index        7 MB
//  * Other noteworthy sections:
//     .eh_frame         27 MB
//     .eh_frame_hdr     4 MB
//     .rodata section   59 MB
//     .symtab           21 MB
//     .strtab           99 MB
//  * Compilation units:                              33 K
//  * DWARF DIEs:                                     83 M
//  * DWARF attributes:                               275 M
//  * Functions:                                      600 K
//  * Functions with address range:                   12 M
//  * Structs/classes/unions/enums:                   2.3 M
//  * Fields of structs/classes/unions:               3 M
//  * Variables and function parameters:              38 M
//  * Variable loc ranges:                            21 M
//  * Inlined function calls:                         9 M
//  * Inline function ranges:                         12 M
//  * Total length of mangled function names:         926 MB
//  * Total length of fully-qualified function names: 1800 MB
//  * Total length of unqualified function names:     165 MB
//  * Total length of variable/arg/field names:       40 MB
//  * Total length of fully-qualified type names:     273 MB
//  * 73% of functions and 57% of types are template instantiations. This sounds suspiciously low, maybe I didn't count right.
//  * In .eh_frame:
//     - CIEs: 4
//     - FDEs: 533 K
//     - rows: 4.6 M
//     - register rules: 17 M
//     - max rows per FDE: 2.5 K
//
// (There are many weird things going on that I don't understand, e.g.:
//   * Most of the 33 K compilation units are duplicates, and in other builds the number is more like 6 K.
//     But 6 K seems too small - surely (?) ClickHouse and its 100+ dependencies have much more files than that.
//   * Template instantiations are probably duplicated a lot - once for each compilation unit that instantiated it. AFAIU, the actual machine code gets deduplicated by
//     the linker, but debug symbols don't. So we should probably try to deduplicate that somehow.
//   * Vast majority of functions have no address range. Are they all inlined? The fraction seems suspiciously high. Maybe they're some useless duplicates that need to be
//     coalesced with the primary instance that does have an address range? Idk.
//   * Lots of variables have no locations. Are they some weird duplicates like in previous item? Or are they optimized out so completely that their value never actually
//     exists anywhere? Or does the compiler fail to emit debug information about their location? Is this why gdb and lldb constantly say "optimized out" about variables
//     that are obviously not optimized out if you look at the disassembly?)
//
// Some more stats, from bin/load_symbols.rs, debug build of clickhouse:
// 8.720 K units, 27.170 K files (34.24x dedup, 1.884 MiB of paths, 7.097 MiB of remap), 2.654 M functions (2.00x dedup, 101.224 MiB, 450.984 MiB of names, 1.111 MiB extra names), 43.018 M lines (1.282 GiB), 13.450 M local variables (718.309 MiB), 11.366 M global variables, 1.556 M types (8.27x dedup, 1.54x offsets, 1.744 M names (435.198 MiB), 118.750 MiB infos, 49.791 MiB fields (1.89% growth waste), 0 B misc, temp 1.312 GiB offset maps, temp 191.406 MiB dedup maps) (128.317 K base types)
